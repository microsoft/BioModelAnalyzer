    <description>This package includes FSPowerPack.Core.Community as well as the Linq libraries. The F# PowerPack is a collection of libraries and tools for use with the F# programming languages provided by the F# team at Microsoft.</description>
    <summary>The additional libraries in the F# PowerPack are functionality which is not part of the core F# release, but enables some development scenarios with F#. The PowerPack include features such as a basic Matrix library and supporting math types, FsLex and FsYacc tools for lexing and parsing, support for using F# with LINQ-based libraries, and a tool for generating HTML documentation from F# libraries. This functionality, which has previously been available in the F# CTP releases, is now available on CodePlex. The F# PowerPack will continue to evolve seperately from the main F# releases, and the features will continue to be improved and iterated upon.</summary>
